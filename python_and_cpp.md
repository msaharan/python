This document lists the features of Python and C++ and compares them. It also lists the differences between the two languages and provides examples of how to use them together. 

## Features of Python
- Python is a high-level, interpreted language that is easy to learn and use.
- Python has a large standard library that provides a wide range of modules and functions for various tasks.
- Python supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming paradigms.
- Python has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management, which makes it easy to write and maintain code.

## Features of C++
- C++ is a low-level, compiled language that is fast and efficient.
- C++ has a rich standard library that provides a wide range of modules and functions for various tasks.
- C++ supports object-oriented, imperative, and generic programming paradigms.
- C++ has a static type system and manual memory management, which gives the programmer more control over the code.

## Differences between Python and C++
- Python is a high-level, interpreted language, while C++ is a low-level, compiled language.
- Python has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management, while C++ has a static type system and manual memory management.
- Python is easy to learn and use, while C++ is more complex and requires more effort to learn and use effectively.
- Python is slower than C++ in terms of execution speed, but it is faster to write and maintain code in Python than in C++.
